scrollIntoView- 
A DOM method that scrolls the page so the element comes into view.

Works for any scrollable container

Often used in React with refs (useRef)


How it works

useRef() → gets a reference to the element

ref.current.scrollIntoView() → scrolls so this element is visible

Optionally, { behavior: "smooth" } → scrolls smoothly
