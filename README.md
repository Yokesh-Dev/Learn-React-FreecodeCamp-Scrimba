# ⚛️ React Fundamentals & Projects – Hands-On Course

This repository documents my completion of a **comprehensive React course** focused on *learning by building*. Instead of passively watching tutorials, this course emphasized **interactive challenges, real projects, and practical problem-solving**, helping me gain confidence to build real-world React applications.

By the end of the course, I completed **170+ interactive coding challenges** and built **6 fully-functional React projects**, covering everything from static components to state management, side effects, accessibility, and app architecture.

## 🚀 What This Course Is About

Many React courses leave you staring at an empty editor with little idea of how to start. This course takes the opposite approach:

* Learn concepts **by immediately applying them**
* Build complete projects from scratch
* Understand *why* React works the way it does
* Develop real confidence working with React codebases

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Learned

* React fundamentals & JSX
* Component-based architecture
* Props & reusable components
* State management with `useState`
* Event handling & controlled components
* Conditional rendering
* Working with arrays & objects in state
* Forms in React
* Side effects with `useEffect`
* Data fetching & APIs
* Accessibility (A11y) best practices
* Project planning & refactoring
* Modern tooling with **Vite**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **HTML5**
