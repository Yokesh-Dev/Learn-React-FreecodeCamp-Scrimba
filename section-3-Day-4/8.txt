     * Challenge: Move the star image into its own component (Star)
     * - It should receive a prop called `isFilled` that it
     *   uses to determine which icon it will display. (You'll
     *   need to import the 2 star icons into that new component first).
     * - Import and render that component, passing the value of
     *   `isFavorite` to the new `isFilled` prop.
     * - Don't worry about the abiliity to flip this value quite yet.
     *   Instead, you can test if it's working by manually changing
     *   `isFavorite` in state above.
