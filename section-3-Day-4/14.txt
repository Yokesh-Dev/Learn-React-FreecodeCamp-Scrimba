/**
 * Challenge: See if you can figure out how to use the
 * react-markdown package to render `props.recipe` as React
 * elements rather than the plain markdown text.
 * 
 * Use the link in the slide to navigate directly to the
 * package's instructions on how to use it.
 * 
 * Use the `suggested-recipe-container` class on the <section>
 * below to get some free styling 🙂

react-markdown is a React component that safely renders Markdown text as React elements.
We use it to display user-written or dynamic Markdown content in React apps.
It avoids security risks like XSS by not using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
It also lets you customize rendering with plugins and your own React components.


dangerouslySetInnerHTML is a React property used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.
It’s used when you need to render HTML strings that React would normally escape.
The risk is that it can expose your app to XSS (security) attacks if the HTML is untrusted.
Because of this danger, React requires an explicit name to warn developers before using it.
