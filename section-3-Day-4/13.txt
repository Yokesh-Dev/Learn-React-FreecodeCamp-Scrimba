 * Challenge: Get a recipe from the AI!
 * 
 * This will be a bit harder of a challenge that will require you
 * to think critically and synthesize the skills you've been
 * learning and practicing up to this point.
 * 
 * We'll start with a mini-quiz:
 * 
 * 1. Think about where the recipe response should live and how you're
 *    going to make sure it doesn't disappear between each state change in
 *    the app. (I don't mean between refreshes of your mini-browser.
 *    You don't need to save this to localStorage or anything more permanent
 *    than in React's memory for now.)
 * 
 * I'm going to save the response in React state.
 * 
 * 2. What action from the user should trigger getting the recipe?
 * When the user clicks the get a recipe button
