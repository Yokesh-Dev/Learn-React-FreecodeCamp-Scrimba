1️⃣ What is a Server?

A server is a machine (or software) that:

Runs continuously

Handles requests from clients (browser, mobile apps)

Contains backend logic, APIs, databases, authentication

Example:
Node.js (Express), Java Spring, Django running on AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.

2️⃣ What is Serverless?

Serverless means:

You don’t manage servers

Backend code runs as functions on demand

Cloud provider handles scaling, infra, uptime

Examples:
AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, Firebase Functions

👉 Servers still exist, but you don’t manage them

----------------
| Server         | Serverless            |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Always running | Runs only when needed |
| Manual scaling | Auto-scaling          |
| Pay for uptime | Pay per request       |
| More control   | Less infra control    |
