Understanding the FormData Object
FormData: This is a built-in JavaScript object that allows you to easily construct a set of key/value pairs
 representing form fields and their values.
Usage: It is particularly useful for handling form submissions, especially when you need to collect data 
from a form that includes file uploads.

       const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)
This instance then allows you to easily access and manipulate the data submitted through the form.

What is currentTarget?

How Does It Work?
Imagine you have a form with a button. When you click the button, both the button and the form respond to 
the click.currentTarget will refer to the form because that’s where you attached the event listener.


Key Difference
target: Refers to the actual element that was clicked (like the button).
currentTarget: Always refers to the element the event handler is listening to (like the form).
