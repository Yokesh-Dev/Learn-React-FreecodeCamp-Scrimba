Event listner


An event listener is a programming construct that waits for and responds to events or changes in a program's state. In web development, for example, it’s often used to detect user interactions, such as clicks, mouse movements, or keyboard inputs.

Key Points:
It allows developers to run a specific piece of code when a targeted event occurs.
Commonly used in languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript and React, to handle user interactions in web applications.
Can be attached to various elements like buttons, forms, or even the window itself.

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setText(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      alert('You pressed Enter!');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me!</button>
      <input type="text" value={text} onChange={handleChange} onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} placeholder="Type here..." />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Example;
