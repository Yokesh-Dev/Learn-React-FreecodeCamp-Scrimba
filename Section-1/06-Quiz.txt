1. Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX when I 
   call `root.render()`?
All of the elements I create in JSX goes to index.html file into div tag with class root.


2. What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code:
```
console.log(<h1>Hello world!</h1>)
```
An js object old syntax before jsx 

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
root.render(
    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
React only returns or Render a single element, in order to render all the elements need to render wrap all the tags into a single tag.

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
*Imperative* means we need to give specific step-by-step instructions on
accomplish a task.
*Declarative* means we can write our code to simply "describe" *what* should show up
on the page and allow the rool (React, e.g.) to handle the details on *how* to
put those things on the page.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger or greater than the individual pieces themselves.
Resuablity
