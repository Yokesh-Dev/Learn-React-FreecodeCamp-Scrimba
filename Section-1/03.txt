#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).


### Steps to Create a Simple React App

1. **Install Create React App**
   Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and run the following command to install `create-react-app`:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-first-app
   ```

2. **Navigate to Your Project Folder**
   After the installation is complete, go to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd my-first-app
   ```

3. **Start the Application**
   Launch the development server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Your default web browser will open with your new React app running at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Basic Tasks to Complete

1. **Identify App Structure**
   - Look at the files in the `src` folder. Note the `App.js` file which contains your main component.

2. **Modify the Default Message**
   - Open `src/App.js` in a code editor (like Visual Studio Code).
   - Change the line with `<header>` to display a custom message. For example:
     ```javascript
     <h1>Welcome to My First React App!</h1>
     ```

3. **Add a Simple Button**
   - Below the message, add a button that says "Click Me":
     ```javascript
     <button>Click Me</button>
     ```

4. **Save and View Changes**
   - Save your changes and go back to your browser. The text should change immediately due to React's hot reloading feature.
