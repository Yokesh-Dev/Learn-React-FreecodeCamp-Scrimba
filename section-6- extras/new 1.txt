     * Critical thinking time!
     * 
     * We want to indicate to the user that the game is over
     * if (1) all the dice are held, and (2) all the dice have
     * the same value.
     * 
     * How might we do this? Some questions to consider:
     * 
     * 1. Do we need to save a `gameWon` value in state? If so, why?
     *    If not, why not?
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 2. Do we need to create a side effect to synchronize the `gameWon`
     *    value (whether it's in state or not) with the current state of 
     *    the dice?
     * 
     * 
     * Conclusion:
