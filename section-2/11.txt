  Challenge  Pulling in Data from Externa Source
	/**
     * Challenge: See if you can correctly pass the necessary props to the 
     * Joke component in the .map() (and render the jokeElements array) so

-------------------------jokeData.js------
export default [
    {
        setup: "I got my daughter a fridge for her birthday.",
        punchline: "I can't wait to see her face light up when she opens it."
    },
    {
        setup: "How did the hacker escape the police?",
        punchline: "He just ransomware!"
    },
    {
        setup: "Why don't pirates travel on mountain roads?",
        punchline: "Scurvy."
    },
    {
        setup: "Why do bees stay in the hive in the winter?",
        punchline: "Swarm."
    },
    {
        setup: "What's the best thing about Switzerland?",
        punchline: "I don't know, but the flag is a big plus!"

------------my wrong answer--------------
    const jokeElements = jokesData.map((joke) => {
        return <Joke 
        punchline={jokesData.punchline}
         setup={jokesData.punchline}
          /> 
    })
    return (
        <main>
            <p >{jokeElements}</p>
        </main>
    )
}

I was for looking to get data from js file, but we can get it from the  array you are mapped.
-------------------Correct-----------
    const jokeElements = jokesData.map((joke) => {
        return <Joke 
        punchline={joke.punchline}
         setup={joke.punchline}
          /> 
    })
    return (
        <main>
            <p >{jokeElements}</p>
        </main>
    )
}
